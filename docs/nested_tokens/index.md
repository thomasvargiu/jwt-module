# Nested tokens

To use nested tokens, you have to install the 
[`web-token/jwt-nested-token` component](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-nested-token).

```
composer require web-token/jwt-nested-token
```

When this component is installed, encryption algorithms are 
automatically handles by the Algorithm Manager Factory.
