# Signed tokens

To use the signed tokens (JWS), you have to install the
[`web-token/jwt-signature` component](https://github.com/web-token/jwt-signature).

```
composer require web-token/jwt-signature
```

When this component is installed, signature algorithms are automatically
handles by the Algorithm Manager Factory.
